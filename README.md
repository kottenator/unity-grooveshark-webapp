Unity Grooveshark web-app
=========================

Ubuntu Unity web-app for new Grooveshark.

Intro
-----
Few words for people who are familiar with Ubuntu Unity.

Since Ubuntu 12.10 there is a great opportunity to integrate your website's might & magic with Ubuntu Unity interface.
This gives you chance to:
- show your web-app in Unity Launcher (left side-bar) and Dash (apps search popup):

- show specific context actions (right-click on Launcher icon):

Sound menu integration and Launcher context actions are related to current player state.
It will work only after you will start playback on Grooveshark website, sorry for inconvenience.

Probably I need to implement "Play your station" context menu, when you just opened Grooveshark

Reason
------
Why have I created this web-app?

There is an official [Grooveshark web-app](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-webapps-grooveshark) but it is broken from long time ago.

Ubuntu is my favourite OS, I love Grooveshark and use it every day - that's the reason why I've created my own Unity web-app for Grooveshark.
